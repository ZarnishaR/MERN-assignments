Question-1:
What is a URL?
A URL is a type of uniform resource identifier and is address of a resource on the World Wide Web and the protocol used to access it. 
It is used to indicate the location of a web resource to access the web pages.
The URL sends users to a specific resource online such as video, webpage, or other resources. 
When you search any query on Google, it will display the multiple URLs of the resource that are all related to your search query.
The displayed URLs are the hyperlink to access the webpages.
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) contains the information, which is as follows:
The port number on the server, which is optional.
It contains a protocol that is used to access the resource.
The location of the server
A fragment identifier
In the directory structure of the server, it contains the location of the resource.

Question-2:
What are the doctypes of different html versions?
1. HTML5 doctype:This is the most latest version of the document type currently used.
It has no disadvantages and is easier to implement and recall. 
It will correctly validate all HTML 5 features, as well as most HTML 4/XHTML 1.0 features.
Syntax:<!DOCTYPE html>

2. Strict doctype (HTML 4.01): The HTML 4.01 strict doctype validates the written code against the HTML 4.01 spec. 
However, it doesn’t allow any deprecated elements or presentational markups such as <font> elements, or framesets to be used.
It validates loose HTML style markup, for example, minimized attributes and non-quoted attributes (eg required, rather than required=”required”).
Syntax:<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

3. Transitional doctype (HTML 4.01): The HTML 4.01 transitional doctype also validates the written code against the HTML 4.01 spec, the same as the strict doctype.  
It does allow some presentational markup and deprecated elements (such as <font> elements) but not framesets. 
Just like strict doctype, it also validates loose HTML style markup.
Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

4. Strict and Transitional doctypes (XML 1.0): These are the exact XHTML 1.0 coequals of the HTML 4.01 doctypes we talked about 
above, so functionally they are the same, except that they won’t validate loose HTML style markup: it all has to be well-formed XML.
Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

5. Frameset doctypes (HTML 4.01 and XML 1.0): They are functionally the same as HTML 4.01 transitional and XHTML 1.0 transitional independently, but they allow the use of framesets. 
Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">

Question-3:
What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
HyperText is the type of text which is specially coded with the help of some standard coding language called HyperText Markup Language (HTML). 
HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another.
Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP.

HTTPS
HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTP Secure (HTTPS), could be a combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the SSL/TLS convention to supply encrypted communication and secure distinguishing proof of an arranged web server.
HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because HTTPS is certified by the SSL(Secure Socket Layer).
Whatever website you are visiting on the internet, if its URL is HTTP, then that website is not secure.
It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 

Question-4:
What is DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. 
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document.
With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements of HTML using commands or methods provided by the Document object. 
Using DOM, the JavaScript gets access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also add behavior to the HTML elements. 
so basically Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML documents.
HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. 
When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the HTML document directly. 
So, a corresponding document is created(DOM). DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects. 
Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM.
Now, Javascript can access each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.

Question-5:
What are meta tags?
Meta tags are HTML tags used to provide additional information about a web page to search engines and other clients.
They are snippets of text that describe a page's content⁴; however, they don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code. 
Meta tags are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. 
They are always placed inside the `<head>` element of the HTML document. 
While they are not displayed on the page and are only visible in the HTML code, they are machine parsable¹. This means they can be read by web browsers,
which use them to determine how to display content, and by search engines, which use them to understand the content of the page and how it should be indexed.

question-6?
What is W3C?
The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is an international organization that creates standards for the World Wide Web. 
The WC3 is committed to improving the web by setting and promoting web-based standards.
The W3C's goal is to create technical standards and guidelines for web technologies worldwide. 
These standards are intended to keep a consistent level of technical quality and compatibility concerning the World Wide Web. 
Developers who create web applications can have confidence in the tools they're using, as web applications using these standards have been vetted by experts. 
An example of a W3C standard is web browsers. 
Most use W3C standards, which enables them to interpret code such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
